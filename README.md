# BMICaculator  
BMICalculator is providing a simple measurement of a person body mass index, based on his/her weight and height.  
This project is an assignment from my University of Washington - Certificate iOS Development class which covers the following topics:
- Generic and type constraint
- Protocol
- Framework
- Closure (eg: completion handler)
- Settings bundle (a user can chose kg/m or lbs/in to calculate the BMI)
